# Refactoring Horiseons Website

## Description

Our client **Horiseon** approached us to refactor their website to meet accessiblity standards optimizing it for search engines.

## What We Did
We took our clients original index.html file and updated the HTML code with semantic tags, including elements suitable for screen readers. It follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation & comments.

We consolidated the CSS styling by combining duplicate/redundant styling declarations.

## Deployment
The updated site has been deployed at:
[Horiseon GitHub](https://mrsamlaw.github.io/01-HW-CodeRefactor/)
